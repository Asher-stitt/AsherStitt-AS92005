        <H3> Volunteer for tree planting!</H3>
        <p>Volunteering for tree planting is one of the most impactful ways you can help fight deforestation in New Zealand!
            Every native tree helps restore natural ecosystem, support biodiversity and battle climate change.
            Tree planting is a great activity for all age groups, backgrounds, and cultures, and is a great fun way to get involved with your local community and get to meet new people.
            Your small action's are not only contributing to the health of our forests, but also creating habitats for wildlife, reducing erosion and protecting our land and waterways.
          <br>
            <br>
            Join a planting event near you to help make a change in Aotearoa!

        <p>This image to the left  highlights a grave trend of forest loss across New Zealand.
            Figure a shows historic pre-human forest cover, with much of the country once covered in dense native bush (dark green color).
            However, as seen in figure b (2002) after human arrival for many centuries, harsh deforestation has left many parts of our beautiful country bare , and lacking of native forest. The most predominant being eastern and lowland regions.
            This is further exemplified by figure c which shows that some regions have experienced up to 100% forest loss. Finally,  figure d shows the fragmentation index which reveals that enduring forests are not only sparser also deceasing in size.
            Overall these graphs show the grave future of New Zealand's forests if we do not act now.
