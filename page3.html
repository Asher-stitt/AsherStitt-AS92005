        <p style="margin:0px 0px 20px 0px">Deforestation has a deep impact on Maori communities because native forests are considered a taonga and hold spiritual significance.
            For many iwi, the forest is more than just a source of resources, it represents identity, whakapapa, and soul.
            When native forests are cleared Mauri feel like part of their connection to the land is lost, and they also cannot partake in traditional practices like gathering flax or medicinal plants.
            This loss can cause them to feel like a part of them is missing, that their connection to the land and their culture is gone.

       <div class="page3header"><H2> deforestation's affects on farmers</H2></div>
        <p style="margin:0px 0px 20px 0px">Farmers are also affected heavily by deforestation, as trees play an important role in soil health and stability.
            Forests help to protect soil health and reduce erosion by holding the land together their roots so when
             large areas of forest are cleared, rain can wash large layers of soil as nothing is holding it together anymore and deforestation often leaves the ground very unstable as uprooting trees causes large amounts of dirt to surface.
