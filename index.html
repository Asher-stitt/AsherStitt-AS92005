        <H3> Who are we?</H3>
        <p>Save our trees is made up of civilians and school students worried about the futures of the native forests in new zealand.
            Anyone can join and the only requirement is that you hold up our core values of kaitiakitanga for the enviroment and showing manakitanga to the group.
            Together, we raise awareness about issues regarding deforestation, plan protests for stronger forest protection laws, and participate in native bush planting in the community.
            By getting members from all ages and backgrounds we believe we can make a lasting impact on Aotearoa's unique bush for years to come
