        <H3> Volunteer for tree planting!</H3>
        <p>Volunteering for tree planting is one of the most impactful ways you can help fight deforestation in New Zealand!
            Every native tree helps restore natural ecosystem, support biodiversity and battle climate change.
            Tree planting is a great activity for all age groups, backgrounds, and cultures, and is a great fun way to get involved with your local community and get to meet new people.
            Your small action's are not only contributing to the health of our forests, but also creating habitats for wildlife, reducing erosion and protecting our land and waterways.
          <br>
            <br>

        <H3> Use your voice</H3>
        <p>Using your voice is one of the most impactful ways you can make a change in new zealand. By speaking up, you can help influence decisions that affect the future of our native forests.
            This could mean writing letters to your local MP, signing petitions that call for stronger environmental protection, or even joining peaceful protests and climate marches.
            When enough people speak up demanding change, people in power are more likely to listen and take action.  No matter who you are your opinions matter, so reach out to your local MP today or write a letter to help save our native forests!
