        <H3> New Zealand's declining forests</H3>
        <p>This image to the left  highlights a grave trend of forest loss across New Zealand.
            Figure a shows historic pre-human forest cover, with much of the country once covered in dense native bush (dark green color).
            However, as seen in figure b (2002) after human arrival for many centuries, harsh deforestation has left many parts of our beautiful country bare , and lacking of native forest. The most predominant being eastern and lowland regions.
            This is further exemplified by figure c which shows that some regions have experienced up to 100% forest loss. Finally,  figure d shows the fragmentation index which reveals that enduring forests are not only sparser also deceasing in size.
            Overall these graphs show the grave future of New Zealand's forests if we do not act now.

        <H3> Loss of tree cover</H3>
        <p>This chart shows New Zealand's net change in tree cover loss from 2000 to 2020, revealing a worrisome long-term pattern of deforestation.
            ALthough 0.97% may not seem like a large number to put it in perspective 108kha is 1800 square kilometers which is about triple the size of auckland!
            This massive area of land being deforested can lead to many problems for the environment, farmers and animals facing biodiversity loss.
            This imbalance highlights that even though restoration efforts are happening, they are not yet strong enough to fully counter ongoing deforestation.
            Strengthening reforestation programs and protecting existing forest land is crucial for saving our existing forests and helping to create new ones.
